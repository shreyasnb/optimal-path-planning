# Atyuha - Optimal Path Planning - Vishwakarma 2024
This is the repository for the Vishwakarma Awards 2024 on Optimal Path Planning for Multipe UAV Area Coverage.

The folder $$\texttt{area-coverage}$$ on the $$\texttt{main}$$ branch contains the code for our algorithm on generating polygons optimized for number of sides and least redunant area. Branch $$\texttt{Lopa}$$, along with others contains our iterations on other algorithms connected to optimizing for dividing a given area into sub-regions.
