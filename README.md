# Atyuha - Optimal Path Planning - Vishwakarma 2024
<i>This is the repository for the Vishwakarma Awards 2024 on Optimal Path Planning for Multipe UAV Area Coverage.</i>

The folder `area-coverage` on the `main` branch contains the code for our algorithm on generating polygons optimized for number of sides and least redunant area. Branch `Lopa`, along with others contains our iterations on other algorithms connected to optimizing for dividing a given area into sub-regions.
